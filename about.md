I'm a PHD student in UC Irvine, majoring in Computer Science. I obtained Bachelor degree in Computer Science at USTC in 2021. My research interests, which are cultivated by the research experience, involve artificial intelligence, computer vision, bioinformatics, and database.

If you’re interested in me, feel free to get more information from [Pengfei’s CV](files/CV_2021.pdf) and drop me an email.
