### Multi-modal Generation

| Jan 2023 - Present       | &nbsp;         |
| ---- |:---------------:|
| Multimodal generation refers to the ability of artificial intelligence systems to generate content across multiple data modalities—such as text, images, audio, and motion—either individually or in a coordinated way. This represents a significant leap from unimodal models (e.g., text-only) toward more human-like capabilities in perception and expression. Recent advances in machine learning, particularly in large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models, have enabled highly expressive and context-aware generation across modalities. | ![C4](pubimages/C4.png) |

### Large Language Model-Assisted Healthcare

| Sep 2021 - Present       | &nbsp;         |
| ---- |:---------------:|
| Healthcare informatics combines medical data analysis with advanced computing, particularly through bioinformatics and AI applications. Bioinformatics focuses on analyzing biological data like genomics for drug discovery and personalized medicine, while Large Language Models power clinical decision support, patient care automation, and personalized nutrition recommendations. The field faces challenges in data privacy and clinical validation but promises significant advances in personalized medicine and preventive care through multimodal data integration and advanced analytics. | ![R2](pubimages/R2.jpg) |
