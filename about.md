## Research

##### Motion Synthesis and Generation

| Jan 2023 - Present       | &nbsp;         |
| ---- |:---------------:|
|Human motion synthesis and generation is a multifaceted field that combines computer vision, graphics, and machine learning to understand, generate, and control human movements. It encompasses three main components: motion understanding, which analyzes human movements and poses; motion generation, which creates realistic movement sequences using data-driven and physics-based approaches; and trajectory control, which focuses on manipulating and directing generated movements to achieve specific goals. The field employs various deep learning models like Transformers, VQ-VAEs, and Diffusion Models, finding applications in animation, virtual reality, robotics, healthcare, and sports, while continuing to address challenges in physical plausibility, style preservation, and real-time performance. | ![C4](pubimages/C4.png) |

##### Healthcare Informatics

| Sep 2021 - Present       | &nbsp;         |
| ---- |:---------------:|
| Healthcare informatics combines medical data analysis with advanced computing, particularly through bioinformatics and AI applications. Bioinformatics focuses on analyzing biological data like genomics for drug discovery and personalized medicine, while Large Language Models power clinical decision support, patient care automation, and personalized nutrition recommendations. The field faces challenges in data privacy and clinical validation but promises significant advances in personalized medicine and preventive care through multimodal data integration and advanced analytics. | ![R2](pubimages/R2.jpg) |
