### Human Motion Synthesis

| Jan 2023 - Present       | &nbsp;         |
| ---- |:---------------:|
| Human Motion Synthesis using generative models focuses on creating realistic human movement sequences through machine learning algorithms that learn from existing motion data. The goal is to produce lifelike movements for a variety of applications, including animation, robotics, and virtual environments. These models are especially valuable in scenarios where motion data is sparse or where real-time motion adaptation is necessary. Human motion synthesis is applied in fields like video game character animation, virtual reality, humanoid robotics, and healthcare (e.g., rehabilitation). However, challenges remain in generating coherent, realistic, and physically plausible motions, as well as ensuring that the generated movements respect human anatomy and physics, which is critical for achieving natural-looking and functional results. |       |

### Large Language Models as Artificial Healthcare Assistant

| Oct 2023 - Present        | &nbsp;         |
| ---- |:---------------:|
| Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT, operating as artificial healthcare assistants, offer transformative potential in medical settings. They enhance patient care by improving communication clarity and efficiency, particularly through their ability to interpret spoken language and convert between unstructured and structured information in medical documentation. These models augment medical competencies, including factual knowledge and communication skills, thereby aiding in clinical decision-making and patient consultations. LLMs also significantly reduce the administrative burden on clinicians by streamlining documentation processes. In research, they democratize access to scientific knowledge, assisting in summarizing complex concepts and improving the communication of research findings. However, their deployment in healthcare necessitates careful management due to concerns about misinformation, biases, and potential misuse. Implementing robust data governance, error monitoring, and regulatory compliance is crucial to maximize their benefits while mitigating risks.   |   ![R2](pubimages/R2.jpg)     |
