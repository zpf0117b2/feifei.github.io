#### Research

##### Motion Synthesis and Generation

| Jan 2023 - Present       | &nbsp;         |
| ---- |:---------------:|
| Human motion synthesis and generation is a multifaceted field that combines computer vision, graphics, and machine learning to understand, generate, and control human movements. It encompasses three main components: motion understanding, which analyzes human movements and poses; motion generation, which creates realistic movement sequences using data-driven and physics-based approaches; and trajectory control, which focuses on manipulating and directing generated movements to achieve specific goals. The field employs various deep learning models like Transformers, VQ-VAEs, and Diffusion Models, finding applications in animation, virtual reality, robotics, healthcare, and sports, while continuing to address challenges in physical plausibility, style preservation, and real-time performance. |       |
